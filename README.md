# Sorting-Algorithms
This repository contains the following several sorting algorithms and some with their optimised forms as well.

1. Selection Sort

    The smallest element is selected from the unsorted array and swapped with the leftmost element, and that element becomes a part of the sorted array. This            process continues moving unsorted array boundary by one element to the right.
    
2. Bubble Sort
    Bubble sort is a basic algorithm for arranging a string of numbers or other elements in the correct order. The method works by examining each set of adjacent elements in the string, from left to right, switching their positions if they are out of order.


3. Recursive Bubble Sort
4. Insertion Sort
5. Recursive Insertion Sort
6. Merge Sort
7. Iterative Merge Sort
8. Quick Sort
9. Iterative Quick Sort
10. Heap Sort
11. Counting Sort
12. Radix Sort
13. Bucket Sort
14. Shell Sort
15. Comb Sort
